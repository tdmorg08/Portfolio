======

Purpose: This assignment explores the use of parallel arrays and range matching.
You are to create a calculator that calculates the cost of purchasing a vehicle from a dealership. You must use arrays and array searching to complete this assignment successfully.
Louie’s Dealership is offering a yearly sale of its inventory of cars based on its type. Shown below are the car types and their respective discounts.
Car Type:
% Discount
PreOwned
20%
Certified-PreOwned
15%
New
10%
 
If the user selects the PreOwned selection, then a 20% discount will be applied and taken off the price of the car. These car types will be used within a combo box. Be sure to validate that the user has selected one of the combo box options. If the user does not select a value, have a message box that displays, “You must select a car type!”.
 
The cars that the dealership currently has in stock and their respective prices are shown in the table below. These cars need to be within a combo box. Be sure to validate that the user has selected one of the combo box options. If the user does not select a value, have a message box that displays, “You must select a car!”.
Car Name
Car Price
Chevy Volt
$27,495
Mclaren 720S
$305,000
Subaru Outback
$28,395
Toyota Camry
$30,771
Saturn Sky
$11,583
Ford Mustang GT
$27,770
Honda Civic
$25,050
 
When the user selects a car from the combo box, the price of the car should be displayed and used for calculations later on.
The user will need to input a down payment amount on the car. The user will input an amount that is at least $0. You must validate that the user has done this. If the user has input in an incorrect value, a message box will appear that displays, “You must enter a valid down payment!”.
 
The user will also need to input their credit score to get a loan from the dealership to help pay for the car. The table below shows the criteria that the user must meet to receive a loan. Be sure to validate this as well. If the credit score is invalid, then a message box should display stating “You must enter a valid credit score! “.
Credit Score Range
Loan Amount
0-500
$0
501-600
$500
601-700
$1,500
701-800
$2,500
 
If the user inputs a credit score of 650, then the dealership will add a loan of $1,500 to the final total to further reduce the amount of money you owe.
Finally, you must display the following in your output labels: the car price, the discount percentage, the down payment, the loan offered by the dealership, and the amount of money you owe.
